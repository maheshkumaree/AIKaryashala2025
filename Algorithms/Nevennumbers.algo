Algorithm : To print first N even numbers.
step-1: start
step-2: print "How many even numbers you want to print? "
step-3: read Count
step-4: Counter = 1
step-5: EvenCounter = 0
step-6: print "The first " + Count + " even numbers are "
step-7: if Counter < Count:
		print EvenCounter + ", "
		Counter + Counter + 1
		EvenCounter = EvenCounter +2
		goto step-7
step-8: print EvenCounter + ".\n"
step-9: stop
